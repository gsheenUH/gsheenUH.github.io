The Smart Campus Energy Lab (SCEL) is a student-led VIP project (Vertically Integrated Project) that aims to design and create weatherboxes to gather data such as solar irradiance. The end goal of this project is to assist in UH Manoa's net-zero energy goal by 2035 by collecting and analyzing weather data to better predict the necessary power usage of buildings across campus.

As a part of Team Firmware, our responsibiliity is to maintain the data pipeline from the weatherbox board to the lab server computer. We assist the hardware teams with programming sensor modules and configuring the board modules. During the Fall 2024 semester, we embarked on many quality of life tasks such as creating an Xbee Configuration Script to configure the XBee relay modules without relying on the XCTU program, consolidating database tables across all hardware teams, and a establishing two-way commmunication between the sensor boards and the lab server. These improvements helped to cut down on human error when setting up weatherbox boards and allowed for more flexibility in diagnosing problems.
