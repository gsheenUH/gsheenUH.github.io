*Essay on ESLint and Coding Standards*

Coding standards often seem trivial—focusing on details like indentation style or bracket placement—but they can have a significant impact on productivity and collaboration. By establishing a consistent set of rules, coding standards help keep code uniform, reduce confusion, and simplify reviews. After my first week using ESLint with Visual Studio Code, I’ve come to appreciate its strengths as well as its drawbacks

## ESLint

ESLint excels at spotting formatting errors and minor inconsistencies I might miss. Having it flag issues like typos or undeclared variables gives me greater confidence in my code, especially when working with teammates. Knowing everyone follows the same rule set means less time arguing over formatting and more time focusing on real problems. However, being bombarded with style reminders while actively coding can be distracting. Constant highlights for missing semicolons or required quote types can obscure more pressing logical bugs, which is why I prefer to silence ESLint until I’ve mostly finalized my code.

## What I don't like about coding standards

Adhering to a popular guide—like the Airbnb TypeScript standards—can occasionally feel burdensome. Being forced to use single quotes throughout, for example, slowed me down initially. Over time, though, these habits become second nature, freeing me to concentrate on problem-solving. Moreover, coding standards often serve as learning tools by suggesting best practices—helping developers spot unused variables or risky coding patterns.

## Value of coding standards

No universal style fits every team or project, but most benefit from choosing a standard and applying it consistently. By enforcing a uniform look and feel, coding standards decrease the time spent on trivial debates and increase attention to logic, performance, and design. While some may dismiss them as nitpicking, my experience shows coding standards add real value—just be sure to balance their enforcement with the freedom to code and explore without constant interruptions.
