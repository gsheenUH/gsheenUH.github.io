## Experiences with TypeScript

Typescript/Javascript thus far has been more tedious than I thought. Coming from being used to C and Java programming, I find that there is a learning curve in keeping track of the types of the types of so many variables in JavaScript. Often, especially when it comes to dealing with arrays and objects, I lose track of whether or not I am calling the right item. I am thankful that Typescript allows me to set the type. Doing so helps bring clarity to my state of mind. From a software engineering perspective, I find that this language isn’t necessary, but helps in many developers’ workflow. I did not really find the ES6 features that useful. Or rather I did not see how certain features could be applied to make coding more efficient and easy to read. Perhaps, that is because I am still a beginner to Typescript/JavaScript.

## Thoughts on Athletic programming

Athletic software engineering is something I did not expect to do coming into this class. However, I appreciate the learning opportunities its brought. Athletic software engineering trains me to think more critically about how I approach problems, and it has enabled me to see using AI in a new light. Rather than using AI just for assisting in a problem that I am stuck on, I now also use it to quickly slap together an “if-statement” or some code that would be tedious to type, based on specifications that I give it. While I have not yet tried it in a WOD, I foresee how it can save a lot of time. In the Thursday WOD that I had this week, I attempted the WOD without the use of AI, and I figured out how to solve the problem within Rx time. But then, I spent close to 10 minutes creating a long if-statement because I tried to type it all out and I made some careless syntax errors along the way.

## Practice WODs

The practice WODs do help somewhat in getting into the rhythm of attempt the actual WOD. However, I do not think I need the practice of every single practice WODs. The Typescript content thus far has been pretty simple thus far, and my perspective on the problems is that you either get it and can solve the problems very quickly or you don’t understand Typescript and you DNF. In all honesty, I think the speed between Rx and DNF is irrelevant, especially when AI is involved. In fact, I think allowing AI cheapens the achievement of getting Rx. Half of the battle of speed is simply typing out the code and AI can do most of that for you if you prompt it right.

## Use of AI in Writing

I did not use AI in the writing of this essay because AI tends to produce an overly robotic version unless prompted exactly how I want. Even if I prompted AI to produce an essay that does not detracts from my experiences or my tone, it is not worth the hassle to proofread and edit the AI generated essay.
