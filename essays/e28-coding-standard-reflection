*Interests in Software Engineering and Technology*

Computer engineering has always captivated me due to its transformative power. The ability to write code and see it materialize into functional systems—whether in artificial intelligence, optimized hardware, or cybersecurity solutions—feels almost like modern-day magic. From smartphones to autonomous vehicles, computer systems are embedded in nearly every aspect of modern life. The prospect of contributing to these advancements motivates me to explore the evolving landscape of technology.

## My fascination with computer engineering

Several fields within software engineering and computer engineering particularly stand out to me. Artificial intelligence continues to revolutionize industries by enhancing decision-making processes, making it a compelling area to explore. Computer architecture fascinates me due to its role in optimizing system performance and efficiency. Cybersecurity has become increasingly vital as digital threats grow more sophisticated, and I am eager to understand and develop secure computing environments. Additionally, robotics integrates both hardware and software, enabling machines to interact intelligently with the physical world. These disciplines are deeply interconnected, and I aim to build a strong foundation in each before determining a specific career focus.

## Broad areas of interest

To prepare for a future in software engineering, I seek to develop a diverse set of technical skills. On the software side, mastering full-stack development will allow me to build scalable and efficient applications using modern frameworks and best practices. On the hardware side, gaining proficiency in low-level tools such as SystemVerilog will enhance my understanding of digital system design and optimization. This combination of software and hardware expertise will enable me to work on complex engineering problems, ensuring that both the software and underlying hardware components function seamlessly together.

## Intersection between technology and creativity

Beyond technical problem-solving, I am also intrigued by the creative aspects of software engineering. The intersection between technology and storytelling, whether through game development, or immersive digital experiences, highlights the expressive potential of programming. Just as an author crafts a compelling narrative, a software engineer can design systems that bring ideas to life in interactive and impactful ways. Exploring this balance between logic and creativity adds another dimension to my passion for technology.

## Goals for ICS 314

In ICS 314, I look forward to applying my knowledge through hands-on development projects. One of my primary goals is to build a portfolio-worthy project that reflects both technical proficiency and innovative thinking. The course provides an opportunity to refine problem-solving skills, gain experience with industry-standard development practices, and collaborate effectively within a team environment. By the end of the course, I hope to strengthen my ability to design, implement, and evaluate software solutions in practical settings.

## Long term goal

My long-term goal is to contribute to the next wave of technological innovation. Whether by designing secure computing architectures, developing AI-driven applications, or advancing robotic systems, I want to be at the forefront of impactful developments. The rapidly evolving nature of technology presents endless opportunities, and I am committed to continuous learning to remain adaptable in this dynamic field. By deepening my expertise in both software and hardware, I aspire to become a versatile engineer capable of making meaningful contributions to the future of computing.
